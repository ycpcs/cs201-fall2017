Drop-in tutoring sessions will be held in KEC 123 on Mondays (6:00 to 8:00), Tuesdays (6:30 to 8:30), Wednesdays (6:00 to 8:00), and Thursdays (6:30 to 8:30).  These sessions are a great way to get help with labs, assignments, or anything else you have questions about.

* Monday (6:00 to 8:00): **Mat Jones, Travis Jones**, Back-ups: Garret Ruths, Rob Jones, Jason Porter
* Tuesday (6:30 to 8:30): **Dan Reightneour, Cody Spath**, Back-ups: none
* Wednesday (6:00 to 8:00): **Ben Linne, Darren Webb**, Back-ups: Garrett Ruths, Travis Jones, Jason Porter
* Thursday (6:30 to 8:30): **Dan Reightneour, Jason Porter**, Back-ups: Cody Spath

We will have in-class tutors this year for assistance with the labs and assignments.  Those tutors will be available for the last 15-30 minutes of each class, and will remain for much of the 45 minute gap that follows the class - for an hour of tutoring.

* Wednesday (10:00 section): **Cody Spath**
* Wednesday (12:00 section-Hake KEC123): **Dan Reightneour**
* Wednesday (12:00 section-Hovemeyer KEC124): **Cody Spath**
