*TUTORS ARE STILL BEING SCHEDULED - WE WILL LET YOU KNOW WHEN TUTORING SESSIONS ARE READY TO START*

Drop-in tutoring sessions will be held in KEC 123 on Mondays (6:00 to 8:00), Tuesdays (6:30 to 8:30), Wednesdays (6:00 to 8:00), and Thursdays (6:30 to 8:30).  These sessions are a great way to get help with labs, assignments, or anything else you have questions about.

The tutors are still being determined:

* Monday (6:00 to 8:00): TBD, TBD
* Tuesday (6:30 to 8:30): TBD, TBD
* Wednesday (6:00 to 8:00): TBD, TBD
* Thursday (6:30 to 8:30): TBD, TBD

We are also expecting to have in-class tutors this year for assistance with the labs and assignments.  We expect that those tutors will be available for the last 15-30 minutes of each class, and remain for much of the 45 minute gap that follows the class - for an hour of tutoring.  We are still working on the availability of in-class tutors.

Please see [How to ask for help](http://faculty.ycp.edu/~dhovemey/askingForHelp.html) for some advice on how to ask good questions (ones that lead to learning.)
